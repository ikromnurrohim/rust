// Constant
// Constants represent values that cannot be changed. If you declare a constant then there is no way its value changes. The keyword for using constants is const. Constants must be explicitly typed. Following is the syntax to declare a constant.

// const VARIABLE_NAME:dataType = value;
// Rust Constant Naming Convention
// The naming convention for Constants are similar to that of variables. All characters in a constant name are usually in uppercase. Unlike declaring variables, the let keyword is not used to declare a constant.

// We have used constants in Rust in the example below −

fn main() {
   const USER_LIMIT:i32 = 100;    // Declare a integer constant
   const PI:f32 = 3.14;           //Declare a float constant

   println!("user limit is {}",USER_LIMIT);  //Display value of the constant
   println!("pi value is {}",PI);            //Display value of the constant
}


// Constants v/s Variables
// In this section, we will learn about the differentiating factors between constants and variables.

// Constants are declared using the const keyword while variables are declared using the let keyword.

// A variable declaration can optionally have a data type whereas a constant declaration must specify the data type. This means const USER_LIMIT=100 will result in an error.

// A variable declared using the let keyword is by default immutable. However, you have an option to mutate it using the mut keyword. Constants are immutable.

// Constants can be set only to a constant expression and not to the result of a function call or any other value that will be computed at runtime.

// Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts of the code need to know about.


// Shadowing of Variables and Constants
// Rust allows programmers to declare variables with the same name. In such a case, the new variable overrides the previous variable.

// Let us understand this with an example.

fn shadowing_variable() {
   let salary = 100.00;
   let salary = 1.50 ;
   // reads first salary
   println!("The value of salary is :{}",salary);
}
// The above code declares two variables by the name salary. The first declaration is assigned a 100.00 while the second declaration is assigned value 1.50. The second variable shadows or hides the first variable while displaying output.


// Rust supports variables with different data types while shadowing.

// Consider the following example.

// The code declares two variables by the name uname. The first declaration is assigned a string value, whereas the second declaration is assigned an integer. The len function returns the total number of characters in a string value.

fn shadowing_variable_different_type() {
   let uname = "Mohtashim";
   let uname = uname.len();
   println!("name changed to integer : {}",uname);
}

// Output
// name changed to integer: 9
// Unlike variables, constants cannot be shadowed. If variables in the above program are replaced with constants, the compiler will throw an error.

fn shadowing_constant() {
   const NAME:&str = "Mohtashim";
   const NAME:usize = NAME.len();
   //Error : `NAME` already defined
   println!("name changed to integer : {}",NAME);
}
